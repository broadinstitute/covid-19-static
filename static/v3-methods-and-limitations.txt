This Laboratory Developed Test is a high-throughput version of the CDC 2019-nCoV Realtime RT-PCR test and has been validated in accordance with the guidance issued by the College of American Pathologists (Mar 19,2020) and the FDA (Feb 29th, 2020).

This test has not been FDA cleared or approved but is being run under the FDAâ€™s Emergency Use AUthorisation (EUA) mechanism.

This test was validated for dry nasal swabs. Method: RNA is isolated from respiratory specimens using MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific); RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA, and subsequently amplified in a Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems ViiA7).

This system provides qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2.

For more detailed information on the test methods and limitations as well as for Fact Sheets for both Patients and Healthcare providers see https://sites.broadinstitute.org/safe-for-school/how-does-covid-19-testing-work-0 Positive results are indicative of active infection with SARS-CoV-2 but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions.

False negative results may occur if amplification inhibitors are present in the specimen or if inadequate numbers of organisms are present in the specimen due to improper collection, transportation, or handling.

If the virus mutates in the RT-PCR target region, SARS-CoV-2 may not be detected or may be detected less predictably. Inhibitors or other types of interference may produce a false negative result.
